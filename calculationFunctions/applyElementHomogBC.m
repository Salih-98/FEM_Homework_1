function [reducedStiffMatrix, rSM] = applyElementHomogBC(elementStiffnessMatrix,SM, r1,r2,r3,r4,r5,r6)
% This is a function which reduces the element stiffness matrix by applying
% the homogenous Dirichlet Boundary conditions. Homogoneous Dirichlet
% Boundary Conditions are applied by eliminating corresponding rows and
% matrices of the element stiffness matrix. 
% -- Function takes in as the arguments the element stiffness matrix, and 6
% values which specify if a one of 6 rows and columns should be
% eliminated, with 1 if the corresponding row and column should be saved, and 0 if it
% should be eliminated. 
% -- NOTE: When applying the boundary conditions, the first three columns
%and rows correspond to the DOFs of the first node, and the other three to
%the second node. This comes in to play when building the global stiffness
%matrix. 

% -- TODO: Again, this is a very rigid code made specifically for a three
% by three matrix. Should try to make it more flexible later.
